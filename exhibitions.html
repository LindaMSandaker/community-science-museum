            <h2>Cosmology</h2>
            <div>
              <p>
                Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition,
                ‘The Sky Above Us,’ explores the night sky and what we can see
                and know about the surrounding universe. We’ll locate the
                various constellations and galaxies that can be seen and learn a
                bit about the early navigators who used the stars to travel by.
                Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from early Arab
                traders to Galileo’s telescope to the latest exploration of the
                planets in our solar system.

            <h2>Evolution</h2>
            <div>
              <p>
                For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with
                the question of our origins. Where do we come from, and how did
                we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution, we
                have had a framework for exploring and understanding our place
                in this world. Discover the origins of life on this planet and
                how the species we know today have evolved in our time. You can
                also take some time to meet a few of the creatures who didn’t
                survive, including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and several
                dinosaurs too.

            <h2>Biology and Medicine</h2>
            <div>
              <p>
                From micro-organisms to the human body, significant
                breakthroughs in biology offer us unique insights into the great
                wonders of the tiny world. Our life expectancy and quality of
                life have improved, thanks to our understanding of medicine.
                Over a series of exhibits, we explore the history of medicine
                and look at some significant breakthroughs, including
                discovering penicillin and the first heart transplant. Many of
                our great medicinal discoveries come from the lab and observing
                animals in the wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to
                it.

            <h2>Robotics and AI</h2>
            <div>
              <p>
                Robotic and artificial intelligence has long been something we
                fantasized about, wrote books, and made movies about. But the
                last two decades have changed this. From practical home
                applications of AI to industrial uses of robotics, the future is
                here. Check out the whole history, of Robotics and AI, from the
                first computer to today's creations; you can even say hello and
                shake the hand of Rob the Robot. But the science in this field
                is moving so fast, who knows what Rob will be able to do next
                year.

            <h2>Ecology</h2>
            <div>
              <p>
                As we learn about the impact humans are having on the planet,
                it's become more critical for scientists to explore creating a
                sustainable future for humans and the whole world. In our
                ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we
                currently face, including global warming, extinction of species,
                and pollution. We show all the positive ways scientists and
                other inspiring people contribute to a brighter future and what
                you and I can do.
